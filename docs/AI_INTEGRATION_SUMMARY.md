- ✅ **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation

### 2. **AI-Powered Assessment Features**
- ✅ **Real-time AI feedback** on every question answered
- ✅ **Intelligent tutoring** that explains why answers are correct/incorrect
- ✅ **Personalized learning** with context-aware assessments
- ✅ **Beautiful UI integration** with loading states and styled responses

### 3. **CSV Question Management System**
- ✅ **Complete CSV support** for external question banks
- ✅ **Smart filtering** by category, difficulty, and question count
- ✅ **Format conversion** between CSV and quiz structures
- ✅ **Seamless AI integration** with CSV questions

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- ✅ **AI availability indicator** shows connection status
- ✅ **Professional styling** for AI responses with 🤖 tutor branding
- ✅ **Loading states** and error handling for better UX
- ✅ **Protocol warnings** for proper server usage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Server Architecture (`server.js`)
```javascript
// Secure OpenAI proxy with environment variable protection
app.post('/api/assess', async (req, res) => {
  const { questionText, userAnswerArray, correctAnswerArray } = req.body;
  // Calls OpenAI API with user's question and answers
  // Returns intelligent assessment or mock response
});
```

### AI Assessment Function (`User_Acceptance.html`)
```javascript
async function callChatGPT(questionText, userAnswerArray, correctAnswerArray) {
  // Secure API call to local server
  // Robust error handling
  // Returns personalized feedback
}
```

### CSV Integration (`csv-manager.js`)
```javascript
class CSVQuestionManager {
  // Complete question management system
  // Filtering, conversion, and AI compatibility
}
```

## 📊 AI Assessment Features

### What the AI Tutor Provides:
1. **Correctness Analysis** - Explains why answers are right or wrong
2. **Learning Reinforcement** - Provides additional context and reasoning
3. **Personalized Feedback** - Tailored responses based on user's specific answer
4. **Educational Value** - Goes beyond just "correct/incorrect" to teach concepts

### Example AI Response:
> 🤖 AI Tutor: Excellent work! Your answer is correct. Creating a definition of done is indeed the key to preventing this situation. A definition of done establishes clear, shared criteria for when work is truly complete, helping avoid disagreements between developers and stakeholders about completion status.

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### AI Response Styling:
- **Distinctive branding** with 🤖 icon
- **Styled containers** with blue theme
- **Loading animations** for better UX
