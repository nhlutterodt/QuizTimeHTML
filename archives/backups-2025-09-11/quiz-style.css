/* DEPRECATED: legacy stylesheet. All rules were migrated to component CSS under
  src/style/*.css and shared utilities to src/style/shared.css. This file is
  intentionally kept as a read-only backup to avoid reintroducing duplicate
  selectors during development. Do NOT edit or re-enable rules here. If you
  need to reference previous styles, copy from the backup in the git history.

  NOTE: This file intentionally contains no active selectors so it will not
  appear as a source in the selector scanner. */
