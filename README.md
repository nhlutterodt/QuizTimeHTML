QuizTimeHTML - Local Quiz App with ChatGPT Assessments

Overview

This project is a static quiz app that now includes per-question AI assessments generated by OpenAI (ChatGPT) via a secure server-side proxy.

Quick start (local)

1. Copy the example env and add your OpenAI key locally (PowerShell example):

   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   # Then open .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY to your real key (do NOT commit it).

2. Initialize npm and install dependencies:

   npm init -y
   npm install express dotenv

3. Start the server:

   node server.js

4. Open the app in your browser:

   http://localhost:3001/User_Acceptance.html

Notes & security

- Do not commit your .env file. Ensure .gitignore contains .env and node_modules/.
- If an API key was accidentally committed, rotate it immediately.
- The server proxy prevents exposing your API key to the browser and avoids CORS issues.

Optional improvements

- Add retry/backoff and rate limiting on the server.
- Deploy the proxy to a secure host (Vercel, Netlify functions, Heroku).
- Add tests for /api/assess and client-side debouncing.
