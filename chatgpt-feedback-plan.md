# Plan: Adding ChatGPT Feedback to Your Quiz App

This plan explains, in simple terms, how we will make your quiz app give you instant feedback from ChatGPT every time you answer a question.

---

## 1. What Will Happen?
- When you answer a question, the app will send your answer (and the correct answer) to ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT will reply with a short explanation of why your answer is correct or not, and why.
- This feedback will appear right below the question, so you get instant, helpful guidance.

## 2. How Will It Work?
- We will add a small piece of code (JavaScript) to your quiz app.
- This code will talk to ChatGPT using your provided API key.
- The code will send the question, your answer, and the correct answer to ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT will reply with a clear explanation.
- There should be online documentation referenced and shared with me so I can review. 

## 3. What Do You Need to Do?
- You do not need to do anything technical.
- I will update your quiz app to include this feature.
- Your API key will be used in the code (it will be visible in the code, so do not share your app publicly unless you change the key).

## 4. What Will It Look Like?
- After you answer, you will see a new message below the question, like:
  > "Your answer is correct because..."  
  or  
  > "Your answer is not correct. The correct answer is... because..."

## 5. Is It Safe?
- Your API key is private. Only people who can see your code can use it.
- If you ever want to remove or change the key, you can do so easily.

## 6. Next Steps
- I will add the code to your quiz app.
- You will be able to use the new feedback feature right away.
